        <h2>Backbone.belay.js</h2>
        <div class="post-content"><p>Backbone.belay is a plugin that helps Backbone developers easily manage multiple ongoing server requests and abort them if they are no longer needed in the application.</p>
<p class='author'>As a long time Backbone developer and enthusiast, I was very excited to take the time to develop my own contribution to the open source project. Working on this project was a great opportunity for me to learn more about modular JavaScript development and open source project guidelines. It also allowed me to learn more about asset deployment with grunt.js and unit testing with jasmine.js.<img alt='' class='profile' src='/img/portraits/will-round.png' />
