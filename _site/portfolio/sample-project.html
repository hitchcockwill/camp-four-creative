        <h2>Grappple</h2>
        <div class="post-content"><p>Grappple is a company we co-founded in January 2012, which was sold to GoalChi in May 2013. Described as the “online social bucket list”, Grappple was a web and mobile application that made it easy to create and track your life goals, connect with others who have &#8220;been there before,&#8221; and share your accomplishments with the world.</p>

This largely focused on the look, feel, and user experience of the web and iOS applications, but also included branding, positioning strategy and promotional materials, HTML email campaigns, pitch decks, and social media coordination.<img alt='' class='profile' src='/img/portraits/alyssa-round.png' />
</p><p class='author'>Will was the team’s senior front-end developer and was responsible for architecting and developing the web application.
