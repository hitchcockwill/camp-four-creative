        <h2>Split</h2>
        <div class="post-content"><p>Split was conceived to make the concept of ”I’ll get you back next time” effortless and fair. It works for everything from divvying up household expenses to casual lunch dates with coworkers, and is a snap to pick up. Split is in the final stages of development and user testing and will be released in the App store soon.</p>
<p class='author'>On this project, I created the custom logotype as well as the visual design for the application. The main goal for this user interface was to keep everything as simple as possible.<img alt='' class='profile' src='/img/portraits/alyssa-round.png' />
</p><p class='author'>I was responsible for building the API and managing the web servers for the application. Split was a great chance for me to explore the ins and outs of Ruby on Rails and RESTful API development.<img alt='' class='profile' src='/img/portraits/will-round.png' />
