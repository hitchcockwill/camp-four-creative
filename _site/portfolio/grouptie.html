        <h2>GroupTie</h2>
        <div class="post-content"><p>GroupTie builds business software that they call Group Relationship Management. Similar to Yammer or Chatter, GroupTie gives organizations the tools they need to help manage large networks of people.</p>
<p class='author'>GroupTie is very feature-rich and customizable, which is one of the main selling points for their users. When designing their marketing site I worked with the team to find a way to emphasize the different features of the site as well as the flexibility of the application for different types of groups. This site design included many custom animations to keep the page engaging as you scroll down.<img alt='' class='profile' src='/img/portraits/alyssa-round.png' />
</p><p class='author'>For nine months I worked full time alongside the GroupTie team as the Senior Front End Web Developer and Lead Designer. I was responsible for creating and maintaining GroupTieâ€™s large scale Backbone.js application, participating in customer development and user testing, and developing brand guidelines and styles.<img alt='' class='profile' src='/img/portraits/alyssa-round.png' />
