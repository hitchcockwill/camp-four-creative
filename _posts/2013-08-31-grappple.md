We co-founded Grappple in January of 2012. After more than a year of development and many iterations of the product and business model, we sold the product to GoalChi in May 2013.
Described as the “online social bucket list”, Grappple was a web and mobile application that made it easy to create and track your life goals, connect with others who have "been there before," and share your accomplishments with the world.

  I worked as the team’s creative director, overseeing everything visual and experience related. This largely focused on the look, feel, and user experience of the web and iOS applications, but also included branding, positioning strategy and promotional materials, HTML email campaigns, investor pitch decks, and social media coordination.

  My role on the team was senior front-end developer. I was responsible for architecting and developing the web application and worked closely with Alyssa to turn her mockups into clean, semantic code and add in interactive elements using CSS and JavaScript.
