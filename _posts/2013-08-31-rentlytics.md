Rentlytics is a growing startup in San Francisco tackling the problem of apartment real estate portfolio management. As they started to seek another round of funding, they came to us to help refine their website with a focus on clean, modern graphics and the ability to easily change and update the information presented down the line. 

<p class="author" markdown="1">
  I worked closely with the Rentlytics team to create a marketing site that would present their applicationâ€™s features in a concise, easily understandable format, assuage any security concernts, and provide relevant information about their team and investors. 
  <br><br>
  One of the main concerns for this project was the need for flexibility and customizability down the road. To ensure that the site could grow and change with the product we designed it as a custom Wordpress theme, allowing their non-technical staff to update the information independent from the dev team. In addition, we developed the site in a modular fashion, allowing for easy addition or removal of sections as needed.
