          Ascendify is a social recruiting platform for companies that are fed up with recruiting in the &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; sense &ndash; a platform that helps large companies to attract talent, connect and build relationships with potential candidates, and automate the hiring workflow. They brought us in in October 2013 to help redesign the talent community portal to help create the &ldquo;talent community of the future.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          The Talent Community Portal is Ascendify&rsquo;s white labeled jobs page. Companies utilizing the Ascendify HR dashboard use the TCP as their jobs page, but in practice it&rsquo;s much more complex than a traditional &ldquo;we&rsquo;re hiring&rdquo; section.

        <p class="two-col">
          Ascendify&rsquo;s Talent Community is a white labeled product that will be used by companies across industries, so one of our biggest challenges was to come up with a solution that looked clean &amp; modern but still worked with many aesthetics. In order to play well with different branding and color schemes we focused on letting the content shine. The resulting design relies on significant use of whitespace and simple elements, which fit well with almost anything you throw at it.

        <h2>Flexibility to Focus</h2>
        <p>
          Another challenge we faced was the wide gamut of content that different companies want to showcase on their career portals. Some have fantastic photography and videos while others boast pages and pages of carefully curated articles. After combing through hundreds of career sites only one thing was true in all cases: everybody wanted to focus on something different.
        </p>
        <p>
          We knew that forcing these companies into one single template wasn&rsquo;t going to benefit anyone. Instead, we created a wide array of different template modules that can be fit together in many different configurations. Thus, the company with lots of photos can show off their foosball table and the company that has invested hundreds of hours into blog posts can display them in an easy to digest way.
