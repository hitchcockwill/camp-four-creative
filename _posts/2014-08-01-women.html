          Women.com is a women-only private advice community&ndash;a place where women can discuss everything from careers to relationships, parenting, and more. We worked to help the Women.com founders nail down their MVP features and visual style.

        <h2>Anonymity &amp; Personality</h2>
        <p>
          The first iteration of Women.com was designed to be 100% anonymous so that women from all walks of life would feel comfortable asking and answering sensitive questions. We needed our interface to feel secure and safe, but we still wanted it to feel warm and welcoming. In order to accomplish this we turned to an old advice expert, Dear Abby. By using Dear Abby’s classic ‘pen names’ we were able to accomplish true anonymity without sacrificing the site’s personality.

        <h2>Simple, Yet Beautiful</h2>
        <p>
          When starting on the visual style for Women.com we had a very clear directive&ndash;feminine and beautiful, but <strong>not</strong> girly. We strove for an aesthetic that was modern yet welcoming, and achieved it through the use of a limited color palette, large photos, and single-page design.

        <h2>Process &amp; Iteration</h2>
        <p>
          When working with the Women.com founders we decided on a rapid iteration process that would let us try out many different styles and features quickly. This allowed us to design the entire MVP through five iterations over the course of only five weeks.
