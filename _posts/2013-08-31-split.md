Split was conceived to make the concept of "I'll get you back next time" effortless and fair. Simply create groups of people with whom you share costs, enter the amounts you spend for the group, and never worry about having to rifle through receipts or tally things up again. It works for everything from divvying up household expenses to casual lunch dates with coworkers, and is a snap to pick up. Split is currently in the final stages of development and user testing and will be released in the Apple App store soon.
