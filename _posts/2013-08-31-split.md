Split was conceived to make the concept of ”I’ll get you back next time” effortless and fair. It works for everything from divvying up household expenses to casual lunch dates with coworkers, and is a snap to pick up. Split is in the final stages of development and user testing and will be released in the App store soon.

  I was responsible for building the API and managing the web servers for the application. Split was a great chance for me to explore the ins and outs of Ruby on Rails and RESTful API development.
